        <h2>A Great British EJC</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Juggling is not just throwing props in the air in order to catch them again. With it comes a community. This community is special to thousands of people around the world. At its heart are the many festivals and conventions which bring us all together; and the largest of which is the European Juggling Convention (EJC).</p>

    <p>Whilst many jugglers may not know this, the first four EJCs were in fact hosted in Great Britain. Those events were modest, with less than fifty people attending, and definitely without any of the features we experience and expect at a modern convention. Since then, the community has grown to thousands, but despite its British roots, the EJC has not returned to its birthplace since 1998. However, we have seen a recent rise in enthusiasm for juggling event organisation in Britain, with many new faces willing and dedicated to bringing our community together. We therefore feel we are now ready to bring EJC back to its roots, and that is what will happen in 2019.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2>Our Plan</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The overwhelming ethos behind our proposal is openness and inclusivity. We want to create a fantastic event that will attract as many people from the juggling and circus arts community as we can. In order to do this, we would like to combine elements and organisational manpower from two of the largest circus events in Great Britain: the British Juggling Convention and Play Festival together with the EJC. We believe that this pooling of strengths, passion, and ideas will help bring together many from the various sub-communities within circus to create a wonderful and diverse event.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    </div>

    <p>To make this event happen we have already assembled a large, experienced team of juggling event organisers, with members including many of the core organisational leaders from the last nine BJCs and various shorter British events. The team is being headed by Jane Randall, who has been the main organiser for three very successful BJCs (2011, 2014 & 2015). Other members include (but are not limited to) Emily Winch, Anna Inman, Natalie Randall, Mark Songhurst, Tom Butterworth, Sam Heaseman and Rob Thorburn.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2>When and Where</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The site is located in Newark, which is the centre of England with good transport links from major airports and train stations.</p>

    <h3>Dates</h3>

    <p>EJC2019 will be held from the <b>3rd to 11th of August 2019</b>.</p>
