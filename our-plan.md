  <h1>Our Plan</h1>
</div>

The overwhelming ethos behind our proposal is openness and inclusivity. We want to create a fantastic event that will attract as many people from the juggling and circus arts community as we can. In order to do this, we would like to combine elements and organisational manpower from two of the largest circus events in Great Britain: the British Juggling Convention and Play Festival together with the EJC. We believe that this pooling of strengths, passion, and ideas will help bring together many from the various sub-communities within circus to create a wonderful and diverse event.
