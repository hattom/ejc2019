        <h1>A Great British EJC</h1>
    </div>

    Juggling is not just throwing props in the air in order to catch them again. With it comes a community. This community is special to thousands of people around the world. At its heart are the many festivals and conventions which bring us all together; and the largest of which is the European Juggling Convention (EJC).

    Whilst many jugglers may not know this, the first four EJCs were in fact hosted in Great Britain. Those events were modest, with less than fifty people attending, and definitely without any of the features we experience and expect at a modern convention. Since then, the community has grown to thousands, but despite its British roots, the EJC has not returned to its birthplace since 1998. However, we have seen a recent rise in enthusiasm for juggling event organisation in Britain, with many new faces willing and dedicated to bringing our community together. We therefore feel we are now ready to bring EJC back to its roots, and that is what will happen in 2019.
