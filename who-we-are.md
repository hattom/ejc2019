  <h1>Who We Are</h1>

To make this event happen we have already assembled a large, experienced team of juggling event organisers, with members including many of the core organisational leaders from the last nine BJCs and various shorter British events. The team is being headed by Jane Randall, who has been the main organiser for three very successful BJCs (2011, 2014 & 2015). Other members include (but are not limited to) Emily Winch, Anna Inman, Natalie Randall, Mark Songhurst, Tom Butterworth, Sam Heaseman and Rob Thorburn.
